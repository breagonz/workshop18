----- UNIT TESTS -----

1. A function called "multiplication" that returns the product of the two input numbers.

  expect multiplication(5,1) to be a number
  expect multiplication('c', 7) to be an error
  expect multiplication(5,1) to be 5

2. A function called "concatOdds" takes two arrays of integers as arguments. It should 
  return a single array that only contains the odd numbers, in ascending order, from 
  both of the arrays.

  expect concatOdds ([1,2,3] , [-1,-2,-3,-3,3,5,9 ]) to be [-1,-3,,1,3,5,9]
  expect concatOdds (["hello", "world"], [1,3,4,5,8,9,]) to be [1,3,5,9]
  expect concatOdds ([2,4,6,8], [10,12,14,16]) should result in error  

----- FUNCTIONAL TESTS -----

1. A shopping cart checkout feature that allows a user to check out as a guest 
  (without an account), or as a logged-in user. They should be allowed to do either,
